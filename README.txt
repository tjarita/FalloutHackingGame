Description: This game is based on a computer hacking mini game in Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. It resembles the classic game Mastermind.

The objective is to correctly guess the word from a list. Hints are given in how many characters you get correct in your guess. For example, you guess MEND and the correct answer is MIND then you would see 3/4 correct. 


Note - You can use any word bank assuming words have newlines. Simply replace enable1.txt with your own file.
